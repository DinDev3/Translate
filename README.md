# Translate

### YOUR MOBILE FOREIGN LANGUAGE BUDDY

Translate is an app that'll help the user learn and practice different foreign languages.

The user can view the translated text of his/ her desired language and also listen to the pronunciation of the translated text. It's also possible for the user to save all the translations of the entered English words/ phrases in multiple languages for offline use.
</br>The game was made for Android OS as part of the Mobile Application Development module that I followed in my 2<sup>nd</sup> year.

![landscapes](docs/resources/landscapes.png)

Landscape layouts were created for all the screens.
<br/>In all the landscape layouts, most of the user input areas were kept to the right and the image displays were kept to the left/ the centre of the screen as required. This makes it easier for the user to enter input and makes it comfortable for the user to view the images displayed as most people are used to reading from the left of the screen.
